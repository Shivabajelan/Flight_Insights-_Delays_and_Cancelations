# Flight Insights: Delays and Cancelations
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on nearly 2,000,000 commercial flights from major US airports. The data includes:

- **Flight details** (date, time, airline, origin, destination)
- **Flight status** (on-time, delayed, canceled)
- **Delay details** (reason, duration)

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to identify trends and factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations. Specifically, this project aims to:

- Analyze delay patterns across different airports and airlines
- Identify the most common reasons for flight delays and cancellations
- Provide stakeholders with an interactive tool to explore flight data by various dimensions

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Power BI dashboard that allows users to drill down into flight delays and cancellations by airport, airline, day of the week, and more.
- **Relational Data Model**: A well-structured data model to ensure accurate and efficient analysis.
- **Custom Calculations**: DAX measures and calculated columns to derive insights from the data.

## Business Intelligence Workflow
This project follows a standard Business Intelligence workflow:

1. **Load and Transform Data**: The raw data is loaded into Power BI and transformed to ensure it is clean and ready for analysis.
2. **Build a Relational Data Model**: A relational data model is created to establish relationships between different tables.
3. **Add Calculated Columns & DAX Measures**: Custom calculations are added to derive additional insights from the data.
4. **Design the Dashboard**: The final step is to design a stunning, interactive dashboard that presents the insights in a clear and engaging way.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes the following key visualisations:

- **Flight Delays by Airport**: Visualize which airports have the highest delay rates.
- **Delay Reasons**: Understand the common causes of delays.
- **Flight Status by Airline**: Compare on-time performance across airlines.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Explore delays and cancellations over time.

## Installation
To view the Power BI dashboard, you will need to have Power BI Desktop installed. You can download it [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
